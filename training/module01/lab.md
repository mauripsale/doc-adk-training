# Module 1: Introduction to AI Agents & Google ADK

## Lab 1: Exploring the ADK Ecosystem

### Goal

The goal of this first lab is to familiarize yourself with the available resources for learning and using the Google Agent Development Kit (ADK). You won't be writing any code yet; instead, you'll be exploring the official documentation and code repositories to understand where to find information and inspiration.

### Step 1: Navigate the Official Documentation

The official ADK documentation is the most important resource you will use. It's your primary source for tutorials, guides, and API references.

1.  **Open the Documentation:** In your web browser, go to the main page of this documentation site.
2.  **Explore the "Get Started" Section:** On the left sidebar, find the "Get started" section. Click through the pages like `About`, `Installation`, and `Quickstart`. Skim through these pages to get a high-level overview of what the ADK is and how to set it up.
3.  **Browse the "Agents" Section:** Look at the "Agents" section in the sidebar. Notice the different types of agents available (`LlmAgent`, `Workflow Agents`, etc.). Click on `LlmAgent` to see the configuration options for the most common agent type.
4.  **Look at the "Tools" Section:** Find the "Tools" section. See the different categories of tools, such as `Built-in tools` and `Function tools`. This will give you an idea of the capabilities you can give to your agents.

**Key Takeaway:** The documentation is your best friend. Knowing how to navigate it will save you a lot of time in the future.

### Step 2: Discover the Official Code Repositories

The ADK is an open-source project with repositories on GitHub. These repositories contain the source code, issue trackers, and, most importantly, a wealth of examples.

1.  **Find the ADK Python Repository:** Search on Google or GitHub for "Google ADK Python". The official repository should be one of the top results.
2.  **Explore the `examples` Directory:** Once you are on the GitHub page, find and click on the `examples` directory. This directory contains practical, runnable examples of different ADK features.
3.  **Find a Simple Example:** Navigate into `examples/python/` and look for a simple agent, such as the `01-hello-world` or `02-tools-and-functions` example.
4.  **Examine the Code:** Click on the Python files (e.g., `agent.py` or `main.py`). Read through the code and the comments. Try to connect what you see in the code with the concepts you skimmed in the documentation (e.g., creating an `LlmAgent`, defining a `tool`).

**Key Takeaway:** The official examples are the best place to find working code that you can learn from and adapt for your own projects.

### Step 3: Understand the Community and Support Channels

1.  **Issues Tab:** On the GitHub repository, click on the "Issues" tab. This is where developers report bugs and request new features. Browsing through the issues can give you insight into the current state of the project and common problems users face.
2.  **Discussions Tab:** If available, the "Discussions" tab is a place for community conversations, questions, and sharing ideas.

### Lab Summary

Congratulations, you've completed your first lab! You now know:

*   How to navigate the official ADK documentation to find guides and references.
*   Where to find official, working code examples in the GitHub repository.
*   Where to look for community support and project updates.

In the next module, you will use this knowledge to set up your own local development environment and prepare for building your first agent.
